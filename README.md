The Web Media API Test Suite 2017
========================================

The Web Media API Snapshot Test Suite 2017 is a cross-browser test suite. Writing
tests in a way that allows them to be run in all browsers gives browser projects
confidence that they are shipping software that is compatible with other
implementations, and that later implementations will be compatible with
their implementations. This in turn gives Web authors/developers
confidence that they can actually rely on the Web platform to deliver on
the promise of working across browsers and devices without needing extra
layers of abstraction to paper over the gaps left by specification
editors and implementors.

This project is forked from the original
[W3C Web Platform Tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) and is customized
to run on web browsers for embedded devices and appliances suchs as TV sets,
set-top boxes, consoles, etc. It supports tests report comparing and testing
a chosen subset of API tests.

This test suite complies with the [Web Media API Snapshot 2017](https://www.w3.org/2017/12/webmediaapi.html).
Note: JPEG File Interchange Format [JPEG], Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition) [PNG], Graphics Interchange Format [GIF], Open Font Format [OPEN-FONT-FORMAT] and WOFF File Format 1.0 [WOFF] are not sufficiently tested in this test suite, because there are no dedicated tests in the W3C Web Platform Tests.

Test server
===========
The server makes it possible to run all tests in a single window.

## Setup

Requirements:

* Python 2.7+ (but not Python 3.x)
* Node.js 8.x.x (LTS recommended)
* Git 2.4+ (should support sparse checkout)
* Bash script support (on windows we recommend Git BASH)

Generate hosts file:
```
$ ./wpt make-hosts-file | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```
on Windows:
```
$ python wpt make-hosts-file | Out-File %SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Encoding ascii -Append
```

Generate test subset, call from WPT root directory:
```
$ ./wmas2017-subset.sh
```

Initialize WAVE Server:
```
$ ./wave init
```

Start WAVE Server:
```
$ ./wave start
```

Start Web Platform Test runner:
```
$ ./wpt serve
```

Open in Web browser (on the same host):
```
http://web-platform.test:8050
```

## Configuration
The default configuration is loaded from the ```config.default.json```
in the root directory. Configurations from the ```config.json```
in the same format as the ```config.default.json```override those.

Provide a different location with ```--config < path_to_config >``` as a
start parameter.

## Test Run Parameters
It is possible to parameterize a test run with various query parameters
provided with the query in the url of the initial request.

Example:
```
web-platform.test:8050/?path=/2dcontext&types=testharness
```

### Query Parameters
Parameter|Description|Example
------|------|------
`path`|Specify tests to run. Can be directory or file. Multiple paths can be chained by using `, `. Paths with leading '/' are interpreted as absolute paths, paths without as regular expressions. (Default: ```/```)|```web-platform.test:8050/?path=/2dcontext```
types|What types of tests to run. Possible types: ```testharness```, ```manual``` and ```reftest``` (Default: ```testharness```)|```web-platform.test:8050/?types=testharness,manual```
`timeout`|Specify a server side timeout in ms after which a test with no result is timed out|```web-platform.test:8050/?timeout=65000```
`token` and `resume` |Providing a token of an unfinished session will resume it.|```web-platform.test:8050/?token=2fb0fb80-63db-4425-8a76-2ea3e6f8269d&resume=1```

Certificates
============

By default pregenerated certificates for the web-platform.test domain
are provided in [`tools/certs`](tools/certs). If you wish to generate new
certificates for any reason it's possible to use OpenSSL when starting
the server, or starting a test run, by providing the
`--ssl-type=openssl` argument to the `wpt serve` or `wpt run`
commands.

If you installed OpenSSL in such a way that running `openssl` at a
command line doesn't work, you also need to adjust the path to the
OpenSSL binary. This can be done by adding a section to `config.json`
like:

```
"ssl": {"openssl": {"binary": "/path/to/openssl"}}
```

### Trusting Root CA

To prevent browser SSL warnings when running HTTPS tests locally, the
web-platform-tests Root CA file `cacert.pem` in [tools/certs](tools/certs)
must be added as a trusted certificate in your OS/browser.

Remarks to testharness.js Statuses
==================================

The documentation of testharness.js is available in [testharness.js API](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html). Section [Basic Usage](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html#basic-usage) says that every single test has as result `PASS`, `FAIL`, `TIMEOUT` and `NOTRUN`. These statuses are also listed in [Callback API](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html#callback-api) section. According to [testharness.js#L1469](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L1469), the status of a single test will be initialized with `NOTRUN` and later set to one of the other values. This means if `TIMEOUT` is disabled (using `explicit_timeout` function described in [Setup](https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/testharness-api.html#setup) section) and the test is not completed (neither `PASS` or `FAIL`), the status will remain `NOTRUN`. This is the interpretation after reading the source code of the testharness.js since there is no explanation in the documentation for the semantic of status `NOTRUN`. 

A test file may contain multiple tests and there is also an overall status for the test file which can be one of the following values: `OK`, `ERROR` and `TIMEOUT`. There is no further explanation for each of these statuses but from reading the code, the `ERROR` status will be set if an [unexpected exception occurred (try catch block)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L2107-L2113), [abort() function](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L2294) is called, [timeout occurs when test in cleanup phase](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L2167) or test file [contains tests with duplicate names](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L2337). The status will be [set to `OK`](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/eed07b8c0de42c2e42432febae2cd31a61a3d2b1/resources/testharness.js#L2344) at the end if it is not set yet (it was `null`) which means no `TIMEOUT` or `ERROR` occurred.

PS: in test reports with comparison of multiple test sessions, the status "-" (with orange background of the table cell) means that the test was not executed on the corresponding user agent.  This can happen if a test runs only if a certain condition is fulfilled or a specific event is fired.
